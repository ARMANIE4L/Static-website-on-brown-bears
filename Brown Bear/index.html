<h3><strong> Brown Bear Subspecies in Europe and Asia</strong></h3>
<p>Four different subspecies occur in Russia alone: Amur Brown Bear; Siberian Brown Bear; Kamchatka Brown Bear; and the Eurasian brown bear. Each of these subspecies is unique in its own way.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Siberian Brown Bears</strong> range right between the Eurasian and <a href="https://outdoors-international.com/kamchatka-peninsula-facts/">Kamchatka</a> Brown Bear in size. They have larger skulls and are more bold around people than some of the other brown bear varieties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eurasian Brown Bears</strong> have a wide range of coloration from brown to blonde to reddish brown and even almost black. There have also been reported cases of albinism . They have round heads, small ears and wide skulls.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amur Brown Bears</strong>, also known as Ussuri Brown Bears can be identified by their elongated skull, smaller forehead,  and much darker color. Some call them the black grizzly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kamchatka Brown Bears</strong> are the largest bears in Eurasia. With a much wider skull than the <a href="https://outdoors-international.com/alaska-peninsula-brown-bear/">Alaska Peninsula Brown Bears</a>, they can can grow nearly as large, from 7 feet- 9 feet in length.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>North American Brown Bears</strong></h3>
<p>There are about 25,000 brown bears across Canada and the Northwest Territories; 30,000 in Alaska and about 1,500 in the lower 48.</p>
<p>Technically these bears are the same as the <a href="https://outdoors-international.com/hunting/grizzly-bear/">grizzly bear</a>. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://outdoors-international.com/difference-between-brown-bear-grizzly/">how to tell the difference between brown and grizzly bears</a>.</p>
